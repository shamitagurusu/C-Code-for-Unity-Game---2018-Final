# C-Code-for-Unity-Game---2018-Final
This is the C# code for the Unity Game that I created for by 2017 CS Class Final. This Code took me around a month to write and implement along with visual and grpahical components.
The code is for my working Unity Game that runs with music, sound affects and visuals made from scratch. This game is a maze with different levels, the objective being
to find and collect an object in a room and move on to the next level until you are able to get to end of the maze. If you fail in the middle of the game you are
forced to restart from the previous level. All of this code not only focuses on the game logistics but the graphic logisistics as well (sound, transition screens,sprites,and the 
position of the cameras that are focused on the Game Board (angle, height,etc.)
